// Branch Sums - A.E. solution

// Write a function that takes in a Binary tree and returns a list
// of its branch sums ordered from leftmost branch sum to rightmost 
// branch sum

// A branch sum is a the sum of all the values in a Binary Tree Branch. 
    // A Binary Tree Branch is a a path of nodes in a tree that starts 
    // at the (root) node and ends at any (leaf) node.
