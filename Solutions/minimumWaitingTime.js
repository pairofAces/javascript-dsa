// Minimum Waiting Time

// Given a non-empty array of positive integers representing
// the amount of time that queries take to execute.
    // Only 1 query can be executed at a time
    // queries can be executed in any order

    // A queries "waiting time" is the time a query needs to
    // wait before starting its execution.
        // Example:
            // If a query is 2nd, then its wait time is the 
            // duration of the 1st query.

            // If a query is 3rd, the its wait time is the 
            // duration of the 1st query.
