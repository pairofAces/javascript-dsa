// Leetcode 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

// Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list.
// The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the
// first two lists. 

var mergeTwoLists = function(l1, l2) {
    let list = new ListNode();
    let head = list;

    while (l1 !== null && l2 !== null) {
        
    }
