// Monotonic Array

// The Prompt

// write a function that takes an array of integers and returns a
// boolean representing whether the array is monotonic.
    // an array is monotonic if its elements are non-increasing
    // or non-decreasing, from left-to-right

    // non-increasing elements aren't just decreasing, they
    // just don't increase.

    // non-decreasing elements aren't just increasing, they
    // just don't decrease.

// Note -> empty arrays and array's of 1 element are monotonic
